# How to extract a ROS-Bag file

`cd` with Matlab in this directory.

Duplicate `config_example.m` and rename it to `config.m`. 

This file holds your local configuration settings, adjust the paths according to your environment (Where is the bag file? Where's its yaml file? Where should the data be written to?).

Run the script `extract_camera_streams.m`. 

Go and grab a coffee or chill a bit.

Come back when it's done.
