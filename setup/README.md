# Instructions

1. The clang-format binary is what styles your code automatically. It needs to placed somewhere in your path. I place it in ~/.local. I am running a Ubuntu system. For other systems maybe it's best to look up online how to install clang-format.
1. Place the 'pre-commit' file in your .git/hooks folder. This file will make sure clang-format runs every time you commit.

We can automate this process with a script. But for now it's not really necessary.
